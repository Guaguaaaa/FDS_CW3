# Ultra Marathon Data Analysis

This project analyzes an ultra-marathon dataset (sourced from Kaggle) using unsupervised and supervised machine learning techniques. The goal was to explore performance patterns among runners and predict relevant metrics such as finish time.

## Objectives
- Explore the distribution and characteristics of ultra-marathon participants
- Identify meaningful clusters using K-Means clustering
- Apply linear regression to model the relationship between features (e.g., age, gender, country) and race results

## Dataset
- Source: Kaggle (Ultra Marathon Runners dataset)
- Preprocessing included handling missing values, feature scaling, and outlier detection

## Methods Used
- K-Means Clustering (to segment runners into performance-based groups)
- Linear Regression (to model finish time and other outcome variables)
- Data visualization (using matplotlib, seaborn)

## Technologies
- Python
- pandas, NumPy
- sklearn, scipy
- matplotlib, seaborn

## Results
- Found 3–4 meaningful clusters with distinguishable performance profiles
- Regression analysis achieved with valid R² value.

## Purpose
This project was part of the Foundamental Data Science course at the University of Edinburgh, on data analysis and machine learning. It strengthened my understanding of applied statistics, clustering, regression modeling, and data preprocessing workflows.
